# Hotel Stock Prediction ML Model Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing a machine learning model to predict hotel room availability and stock levels. The model will enable strategic pricing decisions by assessing competitor hotel stock levels, providing a competitive advantage in dynamic pricing and revenue optimization.

## 1. Business Objective

### 1.1 High-Level Goal
Build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of hotel rooms being sold out at specific times. This model will serve as a competitive intelligence tool to assess black-box competitor hotel stock levels, enabling more strategic pricing decisions for our own hotel rooms.

### 1.2 Business Value
- **Revenue Optimization**: Increase revenue by 3-10% through better pricing strategies based on competitor stock predictions
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Gain insights into competitor demand patterns and inventory management
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Enable real-time pricing adjustments based on predicted market availability
- **Market Positioning**: Optimize room rates relative to competitor availability and demand

### 1.3 Use Case
When a competitor hotel shows available rooms at a certain price point, our model will predict the likelihood of those rooms selling out within different time horizons (next hour, next day, next week). This prediction informs our pricing strategy:
- If high sellout probability → competitor likely has limited inventory → we can price more aggressively
- If low sellout probability → competitor has excess inventory → we may need to adjust pricing to remain competitive

## 2. ML Model Specifications

### 2.1 Prediction Target
The model will predict binary outcomes with associated probabilities:

**Primary Labels (choose one or both):**
1. **Immediate Sellout Prediction**: Will this specific room type at this hotel be sold out in the next data collection cycle (e.g., within 1 hour)?
2. **Time-to-Sellout Prediction**: Will this room be sold out within specific time windows (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week)?

**Recommended Approach**: Start with immediate sellout prediction (1-hour window) and expand to multi-horizon predictions.

### 2.2 Model Architecture Considerations
Based on industry research, consider these approaches:
- **LSTM Networks**: For capturing temporal patterns in booking behavior
- **Deep Learning with Spatial-Temporal Correlations**: To account for location-based demand patterns
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple algorithms for improved accuracy
- **Attention Mechanisms**: To focus on key features during different time periods
